**IoT-Enabled Smart Water Management System for RO Systems**
**Description**
The IoT-based Smart Water Management System (SWMS) automates the process of repurposing RO wastewater for irrigation in urban environments. By using sensors to monitor water quality and soil conditions, the system optimizes water usage, reducing wastage by 50-70%. The integration of IoT technologies allows for real-time monitoring, automated irrigation, and efficient water resource management.

**Key Features**
Automated Water Management: Reuses RO wastewater for irrigation based on real-time soil moisture levels.
Water Quality Monitoring: Uses TDS, pH, and flow sensors to ensure water quality for irrigation.
IoT Connectivity: Real-time data transmission to a centralized dashboard for monitoring and decision-making.
Energy-efficient: Uses an Arduino microcontroller for seamless automation and data processing.
